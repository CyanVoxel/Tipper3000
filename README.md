# Pre-work - **Tipper 3000**

**Tipper 3000** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Travis Abendshien**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total (Not including attemped Xcode setup across multiple computers)

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Working with Xcode on slower Macs (My laptop could no longer handle Xcode, and I had to install a still-slow VM on my PC)
- Learning that Outlets stay as a "ghost" even after the code has been removed (Simulator would crash with generic error)
- Some UI elements were more difficult to change, such as the status bar color and "Back" navigation button for a Settings screen
